#CHATTY APP

Chatty is a full stack web application built primarily with React, Web Socket technology, and Express.

With the capabilities provided by socket technology, Chatty is able to operate as a functional instant-messaging platform, allowing multiple users from different browser windows to communicate with each other via messaging. The application also makes use of Webpack and Babel. Users are able change their display name and see how many other chat users are active on the channel.
